        <p>Hi<br>
        <p>My name is Ellis Yang. I am currently a PSEO student in my last year of high school, working toward an education in Computer Science. 
            <p> Some of my hobbies include reading light novels and manhwas in the genres of fantasy, romance, action, horror, and mystery. <br>
            <p> I enjoy playing games that are easy to grasp. I am also an artist in both music and sketching. <br> 
            <p> I took this course because I want to learn how to create great designs and appeal to people's interaction. <br>
            </p>
